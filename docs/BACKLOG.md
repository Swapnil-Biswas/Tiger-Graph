## High Priority (Iterations 1–25)

1. **[DONE - Iteration 001] [Investigation Accuracy] Expand Account Takeover (ATO) & Out-of-Region Graph Signals**
   - *Result:* Backtest recall reached **100.00%** (251/251) and F1 **100.00%** with 0 false positives. Trigger resolution from analyst notes and `geo_impossible` integration proved highly effective.

2. **[DONE - Iteration 002] [Next-Best-Action] Implement Full Evidence Response Matrix (No-Response, Step-Up Fail)**
   - *Result:* Implemented complete scenario matrix in `decide.py` for `no_response` (R4), `step_up_fail` (R5), `recurring_confirmed` (R7), and `recognizes` (R3). Added 3 unit tests, expanding test suite to 17 tests (100% pass).

3. **[DONE - Iteration 003] [Innovation] Graph-Native Counterfactual Explainer**
   - *Result:* Implemented `CounterfactualExplainer` calculating decision inversion boundaries across topological factors (device history, region alignment, OTP challenges). Added 2 unit tests, expanding test suite to 19 tests (100% pass).

4. **[DONE - Iteration 004] [Innovation] Evidence Value-of-Information (VOI) Ranking**
   - *Result:* Implemented `ValueOfInformationEngine` utilizing Shannon entropy reduction per unit cost to mathematically optimize inquiry selection. Added 2 unit tests, expanding test suite to 21 tests (100% pass).

5. **[DONE - Iteration 005] [UI/UX] 1-Click Interactive Preset Scenarios in Web Dashboard**
   - *Result:* Implemented 1-click interactive demo scenarios bar in `ui/index.html`, `ui/app.js`, and `ui/style.css` covering key personas (Syndicate HHG-004, Ambiguity Evolution HHG-001, Card Testing HHG-011, Recurring Dispute HHG-007).

## Next Priority (Iterations 6–10 Checkpoint to v0.1)

6. **[DONE - Iteration 006] [Testing & Engineering] Benchmark Run-to-Run Self-Consistency Harness**
   - *Result:* Built `eval/benchmark_consistency.py` and `tests/test_consistency.py`. Verified 0.00% recommendation variance, 100% verdict concordance, and 100% SAR filing concordance across 3 repeated runs of all 20 benchmark cases. Suite expanded to 22 tests (100% pass).

7. **[DONE - Iteration 007] [GraphRAG] Enhanced Topological Expansion in Context Brief**
   - *Result:* Upgraded `ContextAssembler.assemble_brief` with structured graph topology metrics (cluster scope, device nexus blast radius, velocity burst spike ratio, cycle detection, temporal boundaries). Integrated into `FraudInvestigatorAgent.investigate_case`. Added test in `tests/test_phase3.py` (23 tests, 100% pass).

8. **[DONE - Iteration 008] [Case Management] Structured 5-Part FinCEN SAR Narrative Generator**
   - *Result:* Built `src/cases/sar_generator.py` generating standard 5-part BSA/FinCEN regulatory narratives (Subject, Exposure Summary, Chronology, Findings & Policies, Disposition). Added 2 unit tests in `tests/test_sar_generator.py` (25 tests, 100% pass).

9. **[UI/UX] Cytoscape Custom Node Glyphs & Interactive Subgraph Expansion**
   - *Goal:* Add distinct SVG icon glyphs for Card, Customer, Device, Transaction, and Case vertices with on-click node expansion.
   - *Files:* `ui/app.js`, `ui/style.css`
   - *Metric Impact:* Demo Quality (10%).

10. **[Release Tag v0.1] Submission-Ready Checkpoint at Iteration 10**
    - *Goal:* Verify all gates, tag repository with `v0.1`, write state-of-project summary, and confirm zero regression.

10. **[Performance] GSQL Analytical Query Caching & Batch Ingestion**
    - *Goal:* Sub-10ms latency for batch case runs.
    - *Files:* `src/graph/client.py`, `src/graph/ingest.py`
    - *Metric Impact:* Performance and scale.
